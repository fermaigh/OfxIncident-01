==============

The welcome screen works perfectly fine
The levels are good, but the blur has not displayed properly while the levels are being processed.
The Timer works great.
After 5 sec low attention captured, game over.
Stop looping the gameover video, asa it fully plays once, it shoulg go back to the welcome screen.


The two addons are required
